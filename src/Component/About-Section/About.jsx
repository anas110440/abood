                    <h3>Hi There! <span>I am Abdullah Taha</span></h3>

                    <p>Iâ€™m an animation director, illustrator and (most importantly!) a dog mom based
                    in Cleveland, OH. I grew up in the magical, far-away Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
                    where I was deprived of bacon and cable television - but granted a unique and
                    broad perspective.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    After attending SCAD and an early career at Scholar and Oddfellows in LA + Portland,
                    I now work from my own little Cleveland studio with my adorable, fluffy
                    assistant, Bandit. I collaborate closely with motion studios and clients like Chipotle,
                    Ecobee and Google on commercial animation + illustration. As a full-time freelancer
                    and online educator, I enjoy diving headfirst into passion projects, advocating
                    for women in the industry and listening to bad music.</p>
